This repository contains my solutions of algorithmic problems from online
contests. The solutions might not be the best ones, but they all work. Also,
I tried to explain main ideas in comments.

In a world dominated by sophisticated frameworks, APIs and eye-candy, we still
need to know things like O(n), algorithm analysis and data structures ;)
