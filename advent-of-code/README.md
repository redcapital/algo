These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

There's a folder for each day, each folder has two programs, one for each puzzle in a day. Programs are written in PHP or C++.

#### Running C++ code

```
$ g++ 1.cpp
$ ./a.out < input.txt
OR sometimes just
$ ./a.out
```

#### Running PHP code

```
$ php 1.php
OR
$ php 1.php input.txt
```

Some folders have additional input files which I used for testing, named `in1`, `in2`, etc.
